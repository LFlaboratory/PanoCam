Repository for the development of a 6x9 and 6x12 modular camera with no movements, to use large/ medium format lens/shutter combinations. Primarily aimed at wide angle lenses (100mm and shorter), although longer lenses could be accomodated using a 3d printed lens cone (currently assuming a flat metal plate for the front of the camera).
Camera main body is a dovetailed wooden enclosure, front is a metal plate. Focus is achieved using a M65 focusing helicoid from Aliexpress.
Film back will be 4"x5" Graflok style, to use a Horseman 6x9 film back initially, and 6x12 later on. Integrated wide ArcaSwiss plate for tripod mounting and two cold shoes for lightmeter and viewfinder.
